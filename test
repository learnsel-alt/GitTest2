The team recognizes the positive contributions made, including the addition of the WebDriverManager layer to the framework, the integration of ExtentReports into the Spring flavor of Spartan, and the implementation of the skip check functionality in the Cucumber layer. These efforts have enhanced the automation framework, and the dedication shown is appreciated.

Improvements Needed:

Adding API Capability in Spring flavor of Spartan: Critical issues such as thread leaks and inadequate token handling were identified, which could have compromised the Spartan Automation framework.

Spartan UI Canary: The JSON string update fix failed during a live demo, leading to incorrect generation and requiring an urgent hotfix.

Dependency on Other Team Members: There is a need to strengthen independence in handling tasks like Maven dependency upgrades and basic execution queries.

Clean Code: There are recurring issues with code cleanliness and maintainability that need attention.

Learning Curve: A steeper learning curve is necessary, especially in mastering new concepts and tools.

Scenario Articulation: Improvement in clearly articulating scenarios is required.

Excel Sheet Logic: The logic implemented in Excel sheets has faced challenges, necessitating greater accuracy and reliability.

Focusing on these areas in the coming months will significantly enhance both individual contributions and the teamâ€™s overall success.
